# 🎥 Project Description — Movie Recommendation System

HexSoftwares_movie_recommendation_project is an exciting machine-learning project I built during my internship at Hex Softwares Pvt. Ltd.
The objective of this project is to create a smart recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and similarity patterns within the dataset.

This repository includes the Movie_Recommendation_System folder, which contains all key components such as the trained model, data preprocessing pipelines, similarity computation modules, and supporting utilities.
The system leverages powerful machine-learning techniques to deliver personalized and accurate movie suggestions, suitable for real-time or bulk recommendation tasks.
